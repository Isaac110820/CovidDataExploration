# CovidDataExploration

This repository contains data on covid deaths and covid vaccinations from February 2020 â€“ April 2021.  The goal of this project is to answer important questions concerning the infection and death rate in various countries around the world.  These questions include: 

- What percentage of the population in any given country became infected with covid?
- What percentage of infections ended in death?
- Which countries have the highest infection/death rate as a proportion of their population?
